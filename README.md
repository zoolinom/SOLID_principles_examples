# SOLID principles examples

- [x] Single Responsibility
- [x] Open-Closed
- [ ] Liskov Substitution
- [ ] Interface Segregation
- [ ] Depandency Inversion

## Single responsibility
A class should have one, and only one reason to change

## Open-Closed
Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
* Separate extensible behaviour behind an interface, and flip the dependencies
